4 Strategic Imperatives:

1. Squad Size
2. Science / Intel
3. Engineering
4. Supplies

NEW Ranger Build: Assault Rifle (Recon, Anti-Beast)
Utilities: Tracer Rounds, Mindshield
- E4: Blademaster (makes melee Ranger an early game beast, plus Phantom absolutely sucks)
- E5: Shadow Strike (synergizes extremely well with Rapid Fire - two opening shots for overall +10% aim, +25% crit chance PLUS +40% flanking crit chance)
- O1: Conceal (extra Shadow Strike, enables Ranger to be a secondary scout unit)
- O3: Implacable (incentivizes kill shots, equivalent to Templar momentum) / Bladestorm
- 04: Untouchable (incentivizes kill shots, equivalent to Templar parry)
- 06: Rapid Fire (makes extremely good use of very consistent high aim from O6 w/ assault rifle - small aim penalty for double damage)


NEW Sharpshooter Build: Pistols (Status Effects, Anti-Lost)
Utilities: Dragon Rounds, Vest
- E4: Return Fire (Free pistol damage)
- E5: Lightning Hands (Free pistol damage)
- O1: Death From Above (Once you get Darklance, this becomes absolutely broken - functionally the same as Serial. It's already amazing for action economy even without Darklance)
- O3: Faceoff (Free pistol damage)
- O4: Steady Hands (Very good passive boost, just as good as the alternative AND it doesn't create a perverse incentive to hunker down instead of shooting)
- O6: Fan Fire (Free pistol damage)


NEW Grenadier Build: Cannons (Grenades, Anti-Armor)
Utilities: AP Rounds, Grenade, Mindshield
- E4: Shredder
- E5: Demolition
- O1: Heavy Ordnance
- O3: Volatile Mix
- O4: Salvo
- O6: Rupture / Saturation Fire


NEW Specialist Build: Assault Rifle (Healing, Anti-Tech)
Utilities: Bluescreen Rounds, Medikit
- E4: Medical Protocol


NEW Reaper Build:
Utilities: Talon Rounds


NEW Skirmisher Build: 
Utilities: Viper Rounds, Proximity Mine


NEW Templar Build:
