4 Strategic Imperatives:

1. Squad Size
2. Science / Intel
3. Engineering
4. Supplies

NEW Ranger Build: Assault Rifle (Recon, Anti-Beast)
Utilities: Tracer Rounds, Mindshield
- E4: Blademaster (makes melee Ranger an early game beast, plus Phantom absolutely sucks)
- E5: Shadow Strike (synergizes extremely well with Rapid Fire - two opening shots for overall +10% aim, +25% crit chance PLUS +40% flanking crit chance)
- O1: Conceal (extra Shadow Strike, enables Ranger to be a secondary scout unit)
- O3: Implacable (incentivizes kill shots, equivalent to Templar momentum) / Bladestorm
- 04: Untouchable (incentivizes kill shots, equivalent to Templar parry)
- 06: Rapid Fire (makes extremely good use of very consistent high aim from O6 w/ assault rifle - small aim penalty for double damage)


NEW Sharpshooter Build: Pistols (Status Effects, Anti-Lost)
Utilities: Dragon Rounds, Vest
- E4: Return Fire (very nice "fuck you" move)
- E5: Lightning Hands (Free pistol damage)
- O1: Death From Above (Once you get Darklance, this becomes absolutely broken - functionally the same as Serial. It's already amazing for action economy even without Darklance)
- O3: Faceoff (Free pistol damage)
- O4: Steady Hands (Very good passive boost, just as good as the alternative AND it doesn't create a perverse incentive to hunker down instead of shooting)
- O6: Fan Fire (Free pistol damage)


NEW Grenadier Build: Cannons (Grenades, Anti-Armor)
Utilities: Bluescreen Rounds, Grenades/Heavy Weapons
- E4: Shredder (Shredding is 100% imperative)
- E5: Demolition (Blow up cars, etc.)
- O1: Holo-Targeting (Helps particularly in the worst-case scenario that you miss on your opening cannon attack)
- O3: Volatile Mix (grenades deal 5-6 damage now)
- O4: Salvo (great action economy twice per mission)
- O6: Rupture (saturation fire is wonky and will often set yourself on fire, plus rupture is brutal against Sectopods, Chosen, Gatekeepers, etc.)



NEW Specialist Build: Assault Rifle (Healing, Anti-Tech)
Utilities: Bluescreen Rounds, Medikit
- E4: Medical Protocol


NEW Reaper Build:
Utilities: Talon Rounds


NEW Skirmisher Build: 
Utilities: Viper Rounds, Proximity Mine


NEW Templar Build:
Utilities: Mindshield
