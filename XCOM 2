Tygan's research directives:

Breakthroughs:
- Always pursue:
        - Rapid Excavation (can instantaneously remove 90 days or more of engineer time. absolutely amazing)
        - Basic weapon improvements (assault rifles, cannons, shotguns, swords, sniper rifles, pistols)
        - Beam weapon improvements
        - Future Combat I/II (GTS upgrades are expensive AS FUCK on Legendary)
- Always ignore:
        - Constructions (provides a one-time small reduction to supply-cost, essentially. just not worth it whatsoever)
        - Modular weapons (you don't need a third slot - just have 2 slots, and sell all basic weapon mods)
        - Faction weapons (spending 10 days on a single soldier is a terrible strategy when there are already so many means to improve that single soldier - PCS, purchasing extra abilities, weapon mods, covert action buffs, etc.)
        - Magnetic & conventional weapons (will become obsolete anyway, just spend the 10 days researching beam weapons instead)
        - Reinforced light & heavy armor (all soldiers should be using medium armor)
        - Ignored: Spare Parts I/II (proving ground cost reduction - does NOT reduce elerium core cost, and elerium cores are the main resource investment for proving ground projects)
        - Ignored: Adaptive PCS, interchangeable upgrades (the usefulness of these breakthroughs is negated by proper planning, especially since the replacement mechanic is janky)

Inspirations:
- Always pursue data decryption inspirations
- If high-priority, pursue the inspiration
- If low-priority, only pursue the inspiration if it takes 3 days or less

Neither:
- If a high-priority research project takes 5 days or less to complete, do it
- If a low-priority research project takes 1 day to complete, do it
- Otherwise, pursue the highest-priority research project regardless of length
